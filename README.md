# OPS445 Assignment 2 – Advanced Python Programming

Welcome to OPS445 Assignment 2!

In this assignment, you will build on your previous work by applying advanced Python concepts to solve more complex problems. The focus is on modularity, error handling, data structures, and system interaction, preparing you for professional-level coding tasks.

📚 Assignment Objectives:
+ Reinforce the use of functions and modules for clean, reusable code
+ Apply lists, dictionaries, and file I/O in structured programs
+ Strengthen exception handling to make programs robust against runtime errors
+ Work with system commands and integrate Python with Linux environments
+ Practice unit testing to validate program correctness
+ Document your work with clear outputs and logs for grading

📂 Assignment Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this assignment:
+ a2.py – Main assignment script
+ Supporting modules (e.g., functions.py, utils.py)
+ Test scripts for validating modular functionality
+ Input/output files for program testing

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Keep your code modular—separate logic into functions and modules.
+ Use try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully, especially with file operations.
+ Test your program with both valid and invalid inputs to ensure robustness.
+ Write unit tests that cover edge cases as well as normal usage.
+ Comment your code thoroughly to make debugging and grading easier.
